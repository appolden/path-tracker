# GR10 Trail Tracker

[GR10 Trail Tracker](https://www.gr-trail-tracker.com/).

The aim of the app/website is to help hikers on the GR10 determine where they are on the path. The phone's GPS is used to determine your location and calculates distances to landmarks (mountain passes, summits, towns, g√Ætes, hotels, campgrounds etc.) along the GR10. If you are using an up to date phone the app/website will work offline in areas without a data connection.

## Key features 

- Works offline, when a data connection is unavailable
- Calculates distances to all points
- Calculates cumulative elevation gains and losses to all points
- Hotels/Gites with phone numbers
- Links to hotel websites (requires a data connection)
